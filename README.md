  Typescript along with React. React was used because it was necessary to create a single page application, SPA (single page application). Fetch was used to make requests from the REST API (Poké Api). Context Api was used to define the colors of the themes and also to be able to access all this content anywhere in my application. Styled component was used to style most of the application's components.
